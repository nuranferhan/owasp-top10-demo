## OWASP Top 10 Vulnerable Web Application

This project is a vulnerable web app and exploit framework that clearly demonstrates the OWASP Top 10 security risks. It helps users learn and practice identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities from both developer and attacker perspectives.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Docker  
- Docker Compose

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start the containers
docker-compose up

# Run in the background
docker-compose up -d
````

### If Running for the First Time or Facing Issues

```bash
# For Windows users: prevent node_modules conflicts
rmdir /s /q vulnerable-app\node_modules

# Clean containers and rebuild
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

---

## Vulnerabilities Detected by Exploit Scripts

When you run the exploit scripts, the following vulnerabilities are demonstrated:

* SQL Injection 
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
* Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) 
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
* Security Misconfiguration 
* Insecure File Upload 
* Path Traversal
* XML External Entities (XXE) 
* Unvalidated Redirects 
* Broken Authentication 

---

## Exploit Scripts

Python scripts are located inside the `exploit/` folder and can be used to test vulnerabilities manually.

### How to Use

```bash
# Go to the exploit folder
cd exploit

# Example: Run the SQL Injection test
python3 exploit_sqli.py

# Run other scripts similarly
python3 exploit_xss.py
python3 exploit_file_upload.py
python3 exploit_xxe.py
...
```

> These scripts do **NOT** run automatically during setup. You must run them manually after the app is running.

```

## Stopping Containers

```bash
# Stop the containers
docker-compose down

# Remove containers and volumes
docker-compose down -v

# Clean all Docker cache
docker system prune -f
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### SQLite3 "Exec format error"

```bash
# Remove Windows node_modules
rmdir /s /q vulnerable-app\node_modules

# Rebuild
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

### CSS Not Loading?

* Check if the CSS file exists inside the container:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it owasp-top10-demo-vulnerable-app-1 ls -la /app/public/css/
  ```
* Test the CSS link directly in the browser:
  [http://localhost:3000/css/style.css](http://localhost:3000/css/style.css)

## Viewing Container Logs

```bash
# View all logs
docker-compose logs

# Only vulnerable-app logs
docker-compose logs vulnerable-app

# Live log tailing
docker-compose logs -f vulnerable-app
```

---

## Accessing the Container

```bash
# Enter the container shell
docker exec -it owasp-top10-demo-vulnerable-app-1 sh

# Exit the container
exit
```
